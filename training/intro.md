# Welcome to the open-source python training

This resource is intended to geoscientists wanting to gain python skills and to take advantage of open-source code.
Training material covers core concepts that would be required to process geo-scientific data.
It is not meant to be a complete Python tutorial - for which there are many excellent resources on the online.
At the end of every module, trainees will be able to execute programs with a simple user-interface (UI)
accessible through [Geoscience ANALYST Pro](https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/).
