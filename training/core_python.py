# # Python Fundamentals
#
# This section offers a brief overview and examples of core Python concepts and syntax. It is not meant to be a
# fully comprehensive resource for Python, but mainly to serve as a primer to get participants started with writing code and to create their first utility program.
#
# This training material uses the [jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.org/) environment that is made up of text cells (
# like this one) and code cells displayed within a web browser (no internet required). Participants are invited to
# write and run the examples provided to get comfortable with the Python syntax. Here are few useful shortcuts for
# jupyter-notebooks.
#
#  - Press **esc + a** to add a cell above, or **esc+b** to add a cell below.
#  - Press **shift + enter** to run a selected cell.
#  - Click on a cell and press **M** to convert to a text cell, or **Y** to convert to code cell.
