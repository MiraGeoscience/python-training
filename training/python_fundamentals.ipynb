    "# Quick note on Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core, Python is an **object-oriented** programming (OOP) language. In short, a computer program is made up of many object variables that hold **attributes** and **methods** specific to itself. An **object** is also refered to as a `Class`. Think of it as a small machine that takes inputs, stores values and does actions on request. Objects can interact with each other to form a program. Object-oriented programming allows for concise code that is easy to read and share with others - which explains the popularity of Python in the world of open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "![oop](./images/object_oriented.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is somewhat in contrast to **imperative** or **procedural-based** languages, such as **C** and **Fortran**. In an\n",
    "imperative framework, variables and functions are chained to form a series of computational steps executed in\n",
    "sequence, but variables themselves don't do anything - they are simple container of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![imperative](./images/imperative.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can also be written in a procedural way, but internally objects are always doing the work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example the numeric variables `x` introduced previously. While it appears to be a simple integer, it is still a Python object with methods. You can access the list of methods available to that specific object by typing `.` then the `tab` key after the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "![methods](./images/methods.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the `imag` method of the integer would return the imaginary part of x (if it was a complex number). In a future section on [Classes](classes), you will be able to create your own type of object with custom methods. To be continued.\n"
