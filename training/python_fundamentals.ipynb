    "store values and does operations on request. Objects can interact with each other\n",
    "to form a program. Object-oriented programming allows for concise code that is\n",

    "\n",
    "This is somewhat in contrast to **imperative** or **procedural-based** languages, such as **C** and **Fortran**. In an\n",
    "imperative framework, variables and functions are chained to form a series of computational steps executed in\n",
    "sequence, but variables themselves don't do anything - they are simple container of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![imperative](./images/imperative.png)\n",

    "Python can also be written in a procedural way, but internally objects are always doing the work.\n",
