# # Best Practice
#
# This section provides a brief overview of best coding practice. Knowing that coding standards may change over time,
# the information provided below reflects principals established by the community and documented in the [PEP8 style
# guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).

# ## Docstrings
#
# One important part of open-source work is to provide sufficient information on classes and methods for others to
# use. The main source of information is provided as a block of text, also referred to as docstring, directly below
# the signature of the method. The information should be written in plain English with a list of input arguments.
# Different styles are possible and generally agreed upon by the development team.
#
# - [sphinx-reST](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html)
# - [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html)
# - [google](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md#38-comments-and-docstrings)
#
# Regardless of the style chosen, it is all about consistency.
#
# In this tutorial, we follow the `sphinx-reST` style as it is compact and standard format with [Pycharm](
# https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm) used for code development.
