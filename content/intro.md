# Welcome to the open-source python training

 This resource is intended to geoscientists wanting to either **automate**
 some part of their work or to perform **advance analysis** on their data. It
 is not meant to be a comprehensive Python resource - for which there are
 many excellent resources online. This training material will give you
 the **skills** to leverage **free** and **open-source** software that has
 been made available by the community. The **goal** is to get
 participants started with writing code quickly and to create their own
 utility programs with a simple user-interface(UI) accessible through
 [Geoscience ANALYST Pro](https://mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst/).


## Why programming?

If you are taking this training, you might have heard about the importance of
programming without really knowing what it is good for. In short, computers
are great at performing a lot of small operations really fast (billions per
second) - things that human can do but a lot slower and often with many
mistakes. By the time you finish this training, you should be able to offload
many of your repetetive and tedious daily tasks to a machine, so that you can
spend more time doing the creative and analytical work - things that you are
actually good at.


## Quick Note on Format

This training material uses the [jupyter-notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
environment that is made up of text cells ( like this
one) and code cells displayed within a web browser (no internet required).
Participants are invited to write and run the examples provided to get
comfortable with the Python syntax. Here are few useful shortcuts for
jupyter-notebooks.

 - Press **esc + a** to add a cell above

 - Press **esc+b** to add a cell below.

 - Press **shift + enter** to run a selected cell.

 - Click on a cell and press **M** to convert to a text cell, or **Y** to convert to code cell.
